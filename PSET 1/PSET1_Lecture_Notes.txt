C
Sample code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) = “when flag is clicked”
while (true) = “forever”
for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) = 50 times
{
	printf(“hello world\n”);
}	

“\n means “put a new line”
#stdio.h = “standard input”

IDE = Integrated Development Environment
	-CS50 IDE (“cs50.io”)

“Source code” = code we write
“Machine code” = code that computers reads
“Source code” -> compiler -> “machine code”

Saving files in C:
	-End with extension .c

!IMPORTANT
Clang runs the compiler in C.
	$ clang hello.c
Running a C file called hello.c would be ran like this in the terminal:
	$ ./a.out

Making a new file with the same output under a new name (a copy essentially)
	$ clang -o hello hello.c
	* new output file would be called “hello”



A helpful list of C commands:

get_char
get_double
get_float
get_int
get_long_long
get_string

Example one:

	int main(void) 
{
	string_s = get_string(“Name”);
	printf(“hello, %s\n”, s);
}

Example two:

int main(void)
{
  int i = get_int ("Integer: ");
  print ("Hello, %i\n");
}

$ make int shows list of commands 
$ don't forget Clang

Example two DOES NOT WORK because the library has to be imported at the top of the file like this: 

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int i = get_int ("Integer: ");
  printf ("Hello, %i\n, i");
}

run $ .\ints
		$ make ints (compiles)
		
// from here, I downloaded the source code. look there for examples.

"float" refers to floating point arithmetic. It can be used to replace int.

Data types so far: int, string, float

compile with $./floats
